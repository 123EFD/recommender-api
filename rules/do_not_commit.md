# Pedagogical Learning & Applied Concepts Rule

## Core Rules for the Agent

1. **Leave Core Logic as Blank for Active Learning**:
   When implementing advanced algorithmic, mathematical, or data-transformation logic:
   - The agent MUST NOT write the core logic directly in the code.
   - The agent must designate it clearly with `[BLANK N]` and provide clear context:
     - Input arguments and data types.
     - Expected output structures.
     - Helpful mathematical or algorithmic hints.
     - A stub returning a fallback or `pass`.
   
2. **Deep-Dive Concept Explanations (Interview & Real-World Utility)**:
   For every blank logic block and advanced concept implemented, the agent MUST explicitly explain:
   - **Applied Concepts & Mathematical Foundations**: Formula derivation, algorithmic complexity (Big-O time and space), and trade-offs.
   - **Real-World Industry Applications**: Exactly where and how this algorithmic pattern is used in modern production engineering (e.g., Google Search, Netflix/Spotify recommendation, Uber dispatch, distributed caching, LLM RAG pipelines).
   - **Technical Interview Edge**: How this concept appears in FAANG/tier-1 technical interviews, talking points to impress interviewers, edge cases to mention, and system design trade-offs.

## Documented Concepts & Learning Algorithms

### 1. "Root-Cause" Prerequisite Back-Tracing Engine
- **Concept**: A student struggling in an advanced topic usually suffers from gaps in foundational prerequisites.
- **Algorithm (DAG Traversal & Topological Sort)**:
  - Models the curriculum as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with courses/topics as nodes and dependency relations as directed edges.
  - Recursively traverses upstream dependencies using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** with cycle detection.
  - Applies **Kahn's Algorithm** or post-order DFS reverse sorting to topologically order prerequisites so fundamentals are studied first.
- **Real-World Applications**:
  - **Build Systems (Bazel, Gradle, Webpack)**: Dependency resolution graphs to determine optimal compilation orders.
  - **Task Schedulers (Apache Airflow, Celery)**: Orchestrating asynchronous DAG workflows without circular deadlocks.
  - **Package Managers (npm, pip, pub)**: Resolving transitive dependency trees.
- **Interview Talking Points**:
  - Explain cycle detection using graph coloring (White/Gray/Black node states) or in-degree tracking.
  - Contrast BFS vs DFS traversal: DFS discovers deep dependency chains; BFS uncovers immediate co-requisites.

### 2. Peer-Validated "High-Yield" Heatmap (Wilson Score Confidence Interval)
- **Concept**: Average user ratings (e.g. 5/5 stars) fail when comparing an item with 1 positive review (100%) against an item with 98 positive reviews out of 100 (98%).
- **Algorithm (Wilson Score Interval)**:
  - Calculates the statistically robust lower bound of a Bernoulli parameter confidence interval:
    $$\hat{p} = \frac{n_{\text{pos}}}{n}, \quad \text{Lower Bound} = \frac{\hat{p} + \frac{z^2}{2n} - z \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n} + \frac{z^2}{4n^2}}}{1 + \frac{z^2}{n}}$$
  - Filters ratings specifically to the targeted cohort: students who initially failed or scored $< 40\%$ and improved after studying the resource.
- **Real-World Applications**:
  - **Reddit & Hacker News Ranking**: Sorting comments and posts by "Best" using Wilson score intervals to prevent fresh single-upvoted comments from beating established top-quality comments.
  - **Amazon / Yelp Review Sorting**: Ranking verified purchaser reviews by helpfulness.
  - **E-Commerce Fraud Detection**: Identifying anomalous conversion spikes from low-sample sellers.
- **Interview Talking Points**:
  - Explain why naive Bayesian average or arithmetic mean fails on cold-start items with few reviews.
  - Discuss the $z$-score tradeoff (typically $z = 1.96$ for 95% confidence).

### 3. Dynamic Micro-Resource Bundling (Multi-Choice 0/1 Knapsack)
- **Concept**: Students have strict time budgets (e.g., 30 mins, 60 mins). A study bundle must pack the highest academic utility without exceeding the time limit, while ensuring multi-modal diversity (reading, video, flashcards, past-year problems).
- **Algorithm**:
  - Dynamic programming 0/1 Knapsack formulation where $W$ is the student's study duration budget, weights $w_i$ are resource durations in minutes, and values $v_i$ are utility scores derived from historical cohort success deltas.
- **Real-World Applications**:
  - **Cloud Resource Allocation (AWS EC2 Spot Instances / Kubernetes Pod Scheduling)**: Packing workloads with CPU/RAM requirements onto hardware servers.
  - **AdTech Bidding (Google Ads / Meta)**: Selecting the optimal set of auction ads to show in a fixed screen slot to maximize expected revenue.
- **Interview Talking Points**:
  - Compare DP table space complexity $O(n \cdot W)$ vs 1D array space optimization $O(W)$.
  - Discuss Fractional Knapsack (Greedy algorithm with value-to-weight ratio) vs 0/1 Knapsack (requires DP or Branch-and-Bound).

### 4. Rich Concept Explanations & Deep-Dive Research Links on Flashcards
- **Concept**: Transforming static flashcards into dynamic, multi-tier knowledge anchors with real-world paper citations (ArXiv, PubMed, OpenStax, Semantic Scholar).
- **Algorithm**:
  - Hybrid RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combining dense vector embeddings with cross-encoder re-ranking.
  - Generating LaTeX mathematical formulas and structured markdown citations dynamically.
- **Real-World Applications**:
  - **Perplexity AI / Consensus**: Academic search engines synthesizing direct answers backed by peer-reviewed research papers.
  - **Medical Diagnostic Assistants (Epic Systems / Med-PaLM)**: Providing clinical recommendations with verbatim citations to clinical trial publications.
- **Interview Talking Points**:
  - Explain RAG retrieval vs parametric memory hallucination.
  - Discuss Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for merging dense vector searches with sparse BM25 keyword searches.

### 5. Live YouTube Search API Integration with Quota Caching
- **Concept**: Real-time retrieval of targeted educational video lectures with metadata caching and fallback heuristics.
- **Algorithm**:
  - Exponential backoff retry strategy with LRU memory caching to conserve YouTube Data API v3 quota (10,000 units/day limit).
  - Title relevance scoring via Levenshtein distance and token set similarity.
- **Real-World Applications**:
  - **Video Streaming Aggregators**: Integrating external media platforms without hitting third-party rate limits.
  - **Content Distribution Networks (CDNs)**: Cache invalidation and cache-aside patterns.
- **Interview Talking Points**:
  - Discuss Cache-Aside vs Write-Through vs Write-Back caching strategies.
  - How to handle API rate limiting using token bucket and leaky bucket algorithms.

## Pinned Architectural Blueprint: Flashcard Topic Relevance, External Question Datasets & Heatmap Integration

### 1. Root Cause of Topic Contamination
- **Legacy Database Noise**: Historic records in `resources.db` contained mismatched topic labels (e.g., OOP record `#10212` labeled as "Computer Networks").
- **Unconstrained Fallback**: When candidates fell short for a time budget, `app/bundler.py` previously executed an unrestricted `ORDER BY RANDOM()` on `General CS`, leaking dynamic programming and recursion into unrelated networking decks.

### 2. The 4-Pillar Architectural Solution
1. **Dual-Tier Generation Model**:
   - Primary: Curated, high-yield university past-exam question banks (PYQs).
   - Dynamic: On-demand PDF RAG generation using authoritative uploaded textbooks (`Topic01-Foundation.pdf`, `Algorithms-JeffE.pdf`, `DiscMathII.pdf`).
2. **Prerequisite-Aware Fallback (DAG Traversal)**:
   - If candidate resources for a specific topic run short, the bundler NEVER falls back to random `General CS`.
   - Instead, it traverses `COURSE_PREREQUISITES` to only source foundational prerequisite cards (e.g. `WIA1005 (Computer Networks)` falls back to its immediate ancestor `WIA1003 (Computer Systems Architecture)`).
3. **Semantic Relevance Embedding Guard**:
   - Computes cosine similarity between candidate flashcard embeddings and canonical syllabus topics:
     $$\text{CosineSim}(\vec{E}_{\text{card}}, \vec{E}_{\text{course}}) = \frac{\vec{E}_{\text{card}} \cdot \vec{E}_{\text{course}}}{\|\vec{E}_{\text{card}}\| \|\vec{E}_{\text{course}}\|}$$
   - Any candidate scoring $< 0.65$ is automatically purged from the study bundle.
4. **Adaptive Wilson Score Heatmap Integration**:
   - Integrates `student_quiz_logs` to adaptively boost high-heat flashcards (proven to help struggling students master threshold concepts).
   - Extensible to any newly registered course in `kAvailableCourses`.
