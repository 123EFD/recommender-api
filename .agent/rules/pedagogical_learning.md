# Pedagogical Learning & Applied Concepts Rule

## 🛑 Strict Zero-Solution Policy for Codebase Blanks

When implementing core algorithmic procedures, mathematical transformations, or diagnostic filters designated for learning:

1. **NEVER Write the Working Solution in the Codebase**:
   - The agent MUST NOT write out the completed algorithm or logic below the TODO/BLANK comment block.
   - The agent MUST NOT write "fallback implementations" or "reference solutions" in the file that defeat the purpose of the blank.
   - The function body for any `[BLANK N]` MUST strictly contain **ONLY**:
     1. **Specification Docstring**: Precise description of the task, input argument types, and expected output dictionary/list structure.
     2. **Step-by-Step TODO Checklist**: Algorithmic steps, formula hints, and constants to use.
     3. **Non-Crashing Stub**: A clean, minimal stub (`pass` with `return None` or `return []`) so the module compiles without syntax errors.

2. **Where Solutions Belong**:
   - The learner writes their own implementation directly in the file.
   - When the learner asks for review or guidance, the agent provides architectural guidance, code reviews, bug diagnoses, and algorithmic explanations **in the chat dialogue**.
   - The agent must NEVER overwrite or inject full code into a `[BLANK N]` file unless the user explicitly commands: *"Apply this solution to the file"* or *"Fill in the blank for me"*.

3. **Mandatory Deep-Dive Documentation for Every Concept**:
   For every blank logic block and advanced concept, the agent MUST explicitly document:
   - **Mathematical & Algorithmic Foundation**: Deep theoretical mechanics, formulas, time/space complexity ($O(N)$), and trade-offs.
   - **Production / Real-World Applications**: Where this exact algorithm or design pattern is used in industry (e.g., Google Search, Netflix/Spotify recommendation, Uber dispatch, distributed caching, LLM RAG pipelines).
   - **Technical Interview Edge**: How this concept appears in FAANG/tier-1 technical interviews, talking points to impress interviewers, edge cases to mention, and system design trade-offs.

## Pinned Architectural Blueprint: Flashcard Topic Relevance, External Question Datasets & Heatmap Integration

### 1. Root Cause of Topic Contamination
- **Legacy Database Noise**: Historic records in `resources.db` contained mismatched topic labels (e.g., OOP record `#10212` labeled as "Computer Networks").
- **Unconstrained Fallback**: When candidates fell short for a time budget, `app/bundler.py` previously executed an unrestricted `ORDER BY RANDOM()` on `General CS`, leaking dynamic programming and recursion into unrelated networking decks.

### 2. The 4-Pillar Architectural Solution
1. **Dual-Tier Generation Model**:
   - Primary: Curated, high-yield university past-exam question banks (PYQs).
   - Dynamic: On-demand PDF RAG generation using authoritative uploaded textbooks (`Topic01-Foundation.pdf`, `Algorithms-JeffE.pdf`, `DiscMathII.pdf`).
2. **Prerequisite-Aware Fallback (DAG Traversal)**:
   - If candidate resources for a specific topic run short, the bundler NEVER falls back to random `General CS`.
   - Instead, it traverses `COURSE_PREREQUISITES` to only source foundational prerequisite cards (e.g. `WIA1005 (Computer Networks)` falls back to its immediate ancestor `WIA1003 (Computer Systems Architecture)`).
3. **Semantic Relevance Embedding Guard**:
   - Computes cosine similarity between candidate flashcard embeddings and canonical syllabus topics:
     $$\text{CosineSim}(\vec{E}_{\text{card}}, \vec{E}_{\text{course}}) = \frac{\vec{E}_{\text{card}} \cdot \vec{E}_{\text{course}}}{\|\vec{E}_{\text{card}}\| \|\vec{E}_{\text{course}}\|}$$
   - Any candidate scoring $< 0.65$ is automatically purged from the study bundle.
4. **Adaptive Wilson Score Heatmap Integration**:
   - Integrates `student_quiz_logs` to adaptively boost high-heat flashcards (proven to help struggling students master threshold concepts).
   - Extensible to any newly registered course in `kAvailableCourses`.
